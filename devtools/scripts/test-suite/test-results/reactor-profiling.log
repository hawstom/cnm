=== REACTOR PROFILING LOG ===
Test run: 2025-38-04 06:38:07

Profiling data will be appended during TEST 40 execution
Each stretch operation triggers reactor callback with timing breakdown

=== REACTOR PROFILING LOG ===

NOTE: Detailed profiling output should appear in AutoCAD console during TEST 40

Expected profiling output format:
  [PROFILE] XDATA write: Xms
  [PROFILE] Attribute write: Yms
  [PROFILE BREAKDOWN] Read state: Ams, XDATA read: Bms, Generate: Cms, Replace: Dms
  [PROFILE] Auto-dispatch (StaOff): Zms
  [PROFILE Dia] Civil3D query: Pms, Config+format: Qms

TO CAPTURE PROFILING OUTPUT:
1. Run TEST 40 manually in AutoCAD
2. Watch console for [PROFILE] messages during stretch operations
3. Copy console output to this file for analysis

ANALYSIS STRATEGY:
- Identify operation with highest cumulative time
- Civil3D queries > 30ms: Consider caching VLA properties
- XDATA writes > 10ms: Check XDATA size, consider batching
- Config+format > 5ms: Verify Phase 3 config optimization applied
- Attribute writes > 15ms: May be unavoidable AutoCAD overhead

Test run summary: 4074ms average per callback
