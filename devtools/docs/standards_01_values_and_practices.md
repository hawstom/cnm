# 3. SCHEDULING
Implementing any standard balances the risk of regression with the cost of confusion. Scheduling implementation accounts for this balance. Every standard should include a one-word scheduling assignment as defined below. The schedule for any standard may move upward as it nears completion; or it may stay low for high-risk standards.

- Very aggressive: Stop everything else to immediately fix every found violation of this standard ANYWHERE.
- Aggressive: Stop everything else to immediately fix every found violation of this standard CONFINED TO THE CURRENT FILE.
- Moderately aggressive: Stop everything else to immediately fix every found violation of this standard in the function or section being edited or written.
- Moderately conservative: Do not create anything that violates this standard. Fix any found violations of this standard only if they were created by you in your own recent memory or you get due advice and approval.
- Conservative:  Do not create anything that violates this standard. Fix any found violations of this standard only if you get due advice and approval.
- Very conservative: Follow an overwhelming local consensus even if it violates this standard.
