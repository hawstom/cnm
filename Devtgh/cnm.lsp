;;; CONSTRUCTION NOTES MANAGER
;;;
;;; PHASING
;;; NOTES allows up to 9 phases named 1 through 9.
;;; To use phases, first build the table block NOTEQTY using TBLQTY1 through TBLQTY9 TGH
;;; attributes for NOTES to fill out in columns as it makes the table.
;;; then when drafting, put the phase for each bubble note in the NOTEPHASE attribute
;;; of the bubble note block.  NOTES will read the phase for each bubble note and
;;; put the quantity into the proper column (phase).
;;; NOTES lets you use different phase columns for different sheets in a plan set,
;;; up to a total of 9.  You just have to define the NOTEQTY block the way you want it in
;;; each sheet.
;;; If you aren't using phases, you can use bubble notes with or without a NOTEPHASE attribute
;;; and you can use a TBLQTY attribute for a quantites column in the NOTEQTY block.
;;; You can't use a TBLQTY attribute if you are using multiple phasing.

;;; Revision history
;;;
;;; 20080410 v4.2.05 See HawsEDC list from here on.  Versions now in sync.
;;; 20050831 v4.2.00 Months of work.  Added ini.  Changed project management. Enhanced menus.  Combined with HawsEDC tools.
;;; 20050415 v4.1.19 Fix a bug for M2Group about Titles.  Was adding limitless zeros internally to NOTETITLES, then having error.
;;; 20050413 v4.1.18 Recompiled for M2Group with correct v4.1 ldrblk.lsp. (4.1.16 had some 4.2 functions ref'd) Yes QT VBA call
;;; 20050413 v4.1.17 Recompiled for M2Group with correct v4.1 ldrblk.lsp. (4.1.16 had some 4.2 functions ref'd) No QT VBA call.
;;; 20050412 v4.1.16 Added workaround for AutoCAD 2005 selection set add, remove, add bug to bubredef.
;;; 20050411 v4.1.15 Enhanced bubredef to redefine old names (without 1 and 2 style code).
;;; 20050204 v4.1.14 Added ShowKeyGrid (now ShowKeyTableGrid) and ShowKeyQuantities (now ShowKeyTableQuantities) registry options and layers in NOTEQTYs. Made TITLES behavior better and consistent between KT and QT.
;;; 20040813 v4.1.13 Fixed LDRBLK.LSP and a few bubble block problems so that bubbles work with variable number of text fields and prompts depending on preset attribute flag.
;;; 20040811 v4.1.12 Improved flow and error trapping in new constnot.txt user wizard: What to do/prompt if no constnot.txt is found.
;;; 20040310 v4.1.11 Fixed bug introduced in v4.1.10.  Search and Save now writes string quantities to NOT, but Tally was expecting numbers.  Now Tally reads string quantities.
;;; 20040309 v4.1.10 Fixed 6 significant figure limitation prin1ing atof 1234.567898 by using rtos 2 8.  Max decimal places is 8, but can be increased.
;;; 20040307 v4.1.09 Changed QT (was Tally) File Selection VBA macro.  Now called via USERS1-4 ACAD setvar/getvars
;;; 20040227 v4.1.08b Revert making tables draw from actual upper-left corner instead of text insertion point.  Change prompt to "Start point"
;;; 20040220 v4.1.08a Made Import always show file dialogue box.  Fixed some CTABONLY bugs.  Made layer edit refresh on exit.
;;; 20040208 v4.1.07 Made Tally compatible with VBA File Select form.
;;; 20040108 v4.1.06 Bug fix. If a .NOT was missing a note, tally crashed while using (assoc (notnum ...) shtlst)
;;; 20040108 v4.1.05 Made tables draw from actual upper-left corner instead of text insertion point.
;;; 20040107 v4.1.04 Changed CONSTNOT.TXT location search and added command to change path.  Made SET TXTHT do nothing if missing 3rd field.
;;; 20031125 v4.1.03 Added user choice for CONSTNOT.TXT location. Combined Bubble1 and Bubble2 styles into one package.
;;;                  Changed various command names, spiffed up menus.
;;;                  Temporarily eliminated package choice from protection/licensing scheme.
;;; 20031117 v4.1.02 Made Tally drawing table look more like sheet list table.  Copied alert messages to prompt line.
;;; 20031113 v4.1.01 Tidied up some variables.
;;; 20030916 v4.1.00 Changed .NOT to native NOTELIST format.
;;;                  Added the SET variables CTABONLY, TBLWID, and PHASEWID to CONSTNOT.TXT
;;;                  Relegated all other wid variables to the tally table only
;;;                  Moved the note description into NOTEQTY as an attribute
;;;                  Removed the special drawing name recognition for AGRA style naming.
;;;                  Added call to authorization
;;;                  Improved column wrapping.
;;;                  Added respect for current viewport freeze
;;;                  Added multiple description lines to tally .CSV
;;; 20030805 v4.0.10 Added TRI to the allowed shape types.
;;; 20030501 v4.0.9 Added SET PHASES to CONSTNOT.TXT, warning message for skipped phases, made SET variables space insensitive
;;; 20030417 v4.0.8 Fixed bug in MAKENOTELIST no phasing PHASELIST '("" 0 "") to '("" 1 "").
;;; 20030317 v4.0.7 Added ACAD.PGP write for TALLY wildcard.  Added error alerts.
;;; 20030304 v4.0.6 Debugged option to select TALLY list file.
;;; 20030227 v4.0.5 Added option to select TALLY list file.
;;; 20030220 v4.0.4 Fixed TXTHT.  Wasn't affecting other size variables.  Added "other drawing spaces" check to notes purge.
;;; 20021120 v4.0.3 Fixed listing excess extra descriptions from next type because of failure to recognize end of type
;;; 12/01    v4.0   Added phasing, editor changer
;;; 2/27/01  v3.23  Stopped the perpetuation of non-count items in the table if no bubble note in drawing.
;;; 2000     v3.22  Stopped the counting of frozen, off, and xref bubble notes.
;;; 2000     v3.21  Stopped the counting of table quantities by renaming table attributes.
;;; 2000            Added user size variables to CONSTNOT.TXT
;;; 1999     v3.20  Improved performance by rewriting code.

;;; Thomas Gail Haws, Feb. 1996
;;; LDRBLK attaches a left or right block to an AutoCAD LEADER and fills in 
;;; special attributes for bubble notes.
;;; LDRBLK explodes any block inserted that doesn't have attributes.
;;; 
;;; Developer notes for NOTE* blocks:
;;; Each NOTE???D block contains a NOTE???L, a NOTE???R block, and left and right NOTEHK blocks.
;;; Each L or R block contains a pline shape and attributes.
;;; The NOTETYPE attribute is preset to the shape of the block.
;;; I use a script to make changes to all the blocks by exploding, editing,
;;; then wblocking from each D block to the L and R blocks.
;;; I make the root entities layer zero so layers.dat truly controls all layers.
;;;
;;; Hint: Toggle the [INSERT] key off to fill in the blanks for a new command.
;;;       This will keep the columns aligned and easy to read.
